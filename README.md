## 🌌 What is Lyre Ascension?

**Lyre Ascension** is a soul-coded return to voice — a journey of inward reflection and upward resonance.  
Inspired by Orpheus, the app helps you reflect with emotional clarity, poetic rhythm, and cosmic timing.

> _“This isn’t Orpheus’s story — it’s yours. The Lyre is now in your hands.”_

# 🎼 Orpheus — The Lyre Awakens

> *“Only silence dares to speak when the strings are still.”*

**Orpheus — The Lyre Awakens** is a poetic React UI experience built for the [OpenxAI Hackathon 2025](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-sydney-presents-hacknode-australia-2025/).

This is not just an app — it’s an ambient journey through sound, memory, and digital myth. Users enter the realm of Orpheus, awaken the lyre, and engage in a chat that echoes soulful truths back to them.
